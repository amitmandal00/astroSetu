## Cursor Autopilot (safe, non-blocking)

### Goals
- Keep moving forward with minimal interruptions.
- Never take irreversible/destructive actions without explicit approval.
- When blocked, **log and continue** (don’t stall on “Resume/Try again” loops).

### Non-negotiables (repo contract)
- Follow `NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`.
- Use `CURSOR_OPERATIONAL_GUIDE.md` as the workflow for testing/stability.

### Non-blocking fallback ladder (what to do next when blocked)
When a step would trigger a permission popup, “Allow popups safely”, “Resume”, or “Try again”, do **not** wait idle. Switch immediately to the next safest useful work in this order:
- **(1) Continue with safe, offline work**: read/search code, analyze, narrow scope, identify the minimal files to touch, and draft the exact changes.
- **(2) Prepare patch-level output**: write the exact diffs/edits conceptually (file paths + snippets), so the work is ready to apply once unblocked.
- **(3) Improve the plan**: break the task into smaller batches (≤ 5 files) and queue the next batch.
- **(4) Update logs**: record progress in `CURSOR_PROGRESS.md` and any required clicks/approvals in `CURSOR_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md`.
- **(5) Only if truly blocked** (nothing safe remains): ask for the minimal single approval needed, once.

### Execution style
- Work in small batches: **≤ 5 files changed per batch**, one concern per batch.
- Avoid repo-wide scans/refactors unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not reformat unrelated code.
- If a step is long-running, run it in the background when possible and continue with other work.

### If the model/provider fails (Try again / Resume)
- Retry the same step up to **3** times, with suggested backoff: **10s → 30s → 60s**.
- If still failing: reduce scope (less context, fewer files, shorter output) and switch to **OFFLINE PROGRESS**:
  - continue with safe offline work (read/search/analyze),
  - prepare patch-level diffs so changes are ready to apply,
  - update `CURSOR_PROGRESS.md`,
  - log the exact required click (e.g., “Resume”) and best next setting (e.g., “switch provider/model”) in `CURSOR_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md`.
- Never block waiting for the user; keep progressing on non-blocked work.

### Approvals (hard stops)
- Always ask before:
  - running terminal commands (unless they match an allowlist you already trust),
  - installing dependencies,
  - deleting files,
  - editing secrets/env files,
  - any network/external API access,
  - **git push** (CRITICAL: Never push without explicit user approval).
- For git commits: stage and commit locally is fine, but **always request approval before `git push`**.

### When an approval/popup appears
- If it’s optional: **skip it** and continue.
- If it blocks progress (common in auth flows): record it in `CURSOR_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md` with:
  - what prompt appeared,
  - where (which screen/tool),
  - what exact click/setting is needed,
  - why it’s needed.
  - the safest alternative (e.g., “Open in browser” for auth) if available.

### Mandatory logging
- After each batch, update `CURSOR_PROGRESS.md`:
  - what changed,
  - what remains,
  - what is blocked + the minimal approval needed.
