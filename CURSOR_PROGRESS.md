# CURSOR_PROGRESS

Use this file as the single “where things stand” view during long Cursor sessions.

## Objective
- (Fill in) What are we trying to accomplish?

## Current status
- **State**: planning / in-progress / blocked / done
- **Last update**: (timestamp)

## Completed (most recent first)
- [ ] (Cursor updates this list after each batch)

## In progress
- [ ] (What Cursor is working on right now)

## Blocked / waiting on approval
- (If blocked, also add an entry to `CURSOR_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md`)
- [ ] (What is blocked and why)

## Next steps (exact)
1. (Next concrete step)
2. (Next concrete step)

## Notes
- Keep changes small: ≤ 5 files per batch.
- If the provider fails (“Try again/Resume”), continue by summarizing intended diffs and listing exact next commands.
- If blocked by a popup/approval, don’t wait: switch to safe offline work and log the required click/approval in `CURSOR_ACTIONS_REQUIRED.md`.
